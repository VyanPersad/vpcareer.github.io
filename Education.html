			<p>The choice to pursue ACCA qualification came from a desire
				to diversify my STEM background into a still relevant and
				industry applicable skillset. ACCA was choosen based on the 
				fact that it is recognised locally and globally.</p>
				<p>It allows me tackle traditional engineering problems with 
				greater breadth as I now gave a greater understanding of 
				both the technical and financial constraints of any particular 
				situation. However it is not limited to being applied engineering 
				circumstances it can stand as a profession of its own,thus 
				allowing me to perform a role that is wholy unique and outide of 
				the engineering field.</p>
				<p>This multi faceted career profile allows me to function across
				many different job functions and roles.

            <p>The MSc. was undertaken at a time when I was employed
				within the oil and gas sector. Having grown up in an oil (and gas) town
				(Fyzabad) and finding a job within the sector it was a some what personal
				endeavour to try and learn as much and hopefully apply it as quickly as 
				possible</p>
				<p>Having grown up within walking distance of production stations, pumping jacks 
				drilling and workover rigs and the then prevailing job and economic situation it 
				seemed te best option for both advancement and a certain technical challenge.
				</p>
				<p>My MSc. in Petroleum Engineering has led me to develop mobile software that enables the user to
				perform a multitude of calculations pertaining to the oil and gas field. This work has given me
				tremendous insight into the new technological tools that are available to young engineers and the
				knowledge on how best to utilize them, especially within the oil and gas industry. This course gave the
				student the insight into, and practice with real world scenarios related to oil and gas field development
				and production.

			<p>My choice to pursue Mechanical Engineering comes out of 
				a life long love of mechanical things, how they work and 
				function.</p>
				<p>It is the culmination of a desire and curiousity with
				making and inventing things, a love of the process of creating 
				and seeing things that can be used in the real world to solve or 
				are themselves the solution to real world problems.      
				</p>
				<p>My degree has provided me with the necessary academic 
				tools needed to function as an engineer in the workplace. 
				Tools include the ability to design and troubleshoot 
				mechanical processes as evidenced by my final year project 
				which was to design and build a custom laptop cooling pad.</p>
