		<div>
		<p class="text">This section is a brief look at what was done within the 
			upstream drilling and workpover sector of the oil and gas 
			industry. It highlights what was done experienced and 
			learnt during my time within this sector.</p>
				<p></p>
		<p class="text">My introduction to the field was as a Graduate Mechanical Engineer 
			in the Petrotrin Horizon's Graduate Trainee Programme. This began 
			in Santa Flora where I was posted to the land based drilling 
			operations of Petrotrin. I would subsequently go on to be 
			witness to offshore drilling operations as well.</p>
				<p></p>
		<p class="text">Overall the experience constituted one of the more rarified
			uses of a Mechanical Engineer as a drilling engineer.</p>	
			<p></p>	
		</div>	
		<p class="highlight"><b>Quick Glance</b></p>		
		<p class="text">
			<ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="text">
				<li>Within the sector projects were undertaken. They include:</li>
				<li>Quality Assurance</li>
				<li>Inspection</li>
				<li>Tender Preperation</li>
				<li>Maintenance</li>
				<li>Research</li>
			</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p class="highlight"><b>Work Experience</b></p>		
		<p class="text">Assissted with the implementation of an asset improvement 
			and management system which was to be used on all the tools in the 
			service of the drilling and workover department utilised by the comapny's land 
			based drilling and workover department.This project saw the design of 
			a maintenance schedule for the tools in service. It involved looking over 
			said tools and determining what is the best way to inspect and service it 
			in house or if third party services would be needed.</p>
			<p class="text">A register of all the tools in service was compiled and the appropriate 
			industrial standard was found and applied to the equipment. This meant working 
			with API or specialty standards that detail the tools in use. If none were 
			present or if it was found the maintenance schedule to be lacking then 
			manufacturer's documentation was consulted </p>

	<div class="card">
		<p class="text">Was tasked with assisting with the preperation of a tender 
			for maintenance services. I was given the resposibility of drafting 
			the technical specifications needed to be executed by the intended 
			service provider. This involved looking at current usage and 
			determining the appropriate duty cycles in addition to looking over 
			prescribed industry or manufacturer standards for maintenance.</p>

		<p class="highlight"><b>On-Site</b></p>
		<div>
			<p class="text">During my respective jobs time was spent on the drilling floor,
				this was a unique and valuable experience as it allowed me to see the 
				tangible results of planned operations. The hands-on work exposed me to the 
				dynamism of the workk floor and allowed me to physically work alongside industry
				professionals. I was there to provide engineering support for the operations 
				at hand, offering solutions and troubleshooting as needed. This meant working 
				with both the on-site crew and service providers to go through available 
				options and execute the desired options.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="text">
				On a daily basis I was responsible for the daily costing of operations based on
				pre-determined metrics. Operations were appraised based on the plan and deviations
				were evaluated and accounted for. Any deviation in operations from the plan had 
				to be justified technically and accounted for financially.
