<p class="highlight"><b>The Abstract</b></p>
<div><p class="text">The aim of the project was to design build and test a device that can lower the temperature of a laptop. 
In addition it aimed to investigate the effect of the lowered temperature on the performance of the laptop.</p>  
<p></p>
<p class="text">The laptop pad was designed, built and tested. The testing consisted of both virtual and real world testing in 
addition to verification by manual calculation. The virtual component utilized SolidWorks COSMOS and FloXpress 
to perform air flow, thermal, stress and displacement finite element analyses on the design.</p> 
<p></p>
<p class="text">The real world testing consisted of measuring the CPU performance, battery life, laptop temperatures, PCMark 
test results and the measurement of program load times. The project built pad was also compared to a commercially 
available generic store bought cooling pad.</p> 
<p></p>     
<p class="text">It was found from the virtual testing that the design put forward was in fact worthy of building. 
It proved that the design elements (eg. Aluminum heat sink) performed as they would be expected to. 
The real world testing proved that the cooling pad improves laptop performance and response time, reduces laptop 
operating temperatures but at the same time reduces battery life.</p>  
<p></p>   
<p class="text">The laptop cooling pad was built, tested and found to increase the performance of the laptop in all the suggested areas. 
In comparison it outperforms the store bought cooling pad in all the measured engineering oriented characteristics, 
however it is second in the rank to the store bought when one considers the consumer oriented characteristics.</p>

<p class="highlight"><b>The Results</b></p>
<p class="text">The aim of the project was to design build and test a device that can lower the temperature of a laptop. 
    In addition it aimed to investigate the effect of the lowered temperature on the performance of the laptop.
    This was accomplished by first designing and iterating through 5 possible designs. The designs were appraised and the 
    desired criteria determined by research and comparisons to xisting products.</p>  
    <p></p>
    <p class="text">Once the designs were approved they were ranked and the best choosen, or a new design based on the 
    favourable features of all was decided upon. This design was then modelled in SolidWorks and various simulations run to
    simulate the real world. Mathematical calculations were also done to confirm the accuracy of the model, of which they 
    closely matched the modelled results.       
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="text">The final part of the project was to build and test it. It was built and tested and the performance was 
    appraised against a store bought model and the performance of a laptop without any cooling pad. It was found to lower the 
    temperature and thus improve performance. It's performance renders the project a success.

</div>
<div class="texttile">
<p class="highlight"><b>Thermal Analysis</b></p>
<p class="text">Overall the pad is performing as it was designed to. 
    The aluminum heat sinks are in fact aiding in the rapid dissipation if heat from the laptop base. 
    It also shows that the lowest temperature obtained is 31Â°C this further substantiates 
    the results of the 2D thermal FEA. It also lends greater credibility to the amount of power 
    that is dissipated by the pad due to its heat sink and fan design.</p>  
    <p></p>

<div class="texttile1">
<p class="highlight"><b>Temperatures</b></p>
<p class="text">Across all measured points the temaperture of the laptop with a cooling pad was lower, this would indicate
    and lead to an increase in performance in accordance with cooler temperatures facilitating greater performance. 
    The project build was on par and better than the store bought cooling pad, a testiment to its design.</p>

<div class="texttile1">
<p class="highlight"><b>Load Times</b></p>
    <p class="text">This would again indicate that with the cooling pad the laptop is performing better. 
        Also if the speed at which the programs load is any indication of how much faster the program will 
        operate, this would indicate that the user would also be able to accomplish tasks faster, 
        leading to an all round better user experience.</p>
