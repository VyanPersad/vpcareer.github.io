		<p class="highlight"><b>Summary</b></p>
		<div>
		<p class="text">This section is a brief look at what was done within the 
			downstream plant based section of the oil and gas industry. I was a 
			part of this sector as a graduate engineer stationed primarily within the 
			design department at the Pinte a Pierre refinery.</p>
				<p></p>
		<p class="text">While here I saw the multitude of individual plants that 
			worked to the make the refinery a single cohesive unit. Stationed within 
			the design department I got to see how the process of troubleshooting 
			and solution generating goes about within the plant environment.</p>
				<p></p>
		<p class="text">The ability to see and be part of the design process of 
			solutions and to see some of it put into action was an accomplishment 
			for me. It is always an eye opening experience to see the other wise 
			abstract mathematics taught in school be put to use practically to 
			generate and prove a solution that works physically in the real world.</p>	
			<p></p>	
		</div>	
		<p class="highlight"><b>Quick Glance</b></p>		
		<p class="text">
			<ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="text">
				<li>Within the sector projects were undertaken. They include:</li>
				<li>Pipe hanger troubleshooting</li>
				<li>Link-seal sizing</li>
				<li>General inspections and appraisal of problems</li>
				<li>Pipe work design and support infrastructure</li>
				<li>Walk-arounds and basic introductions to the various plants</li>
			</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p class="highlight"><b>Work Experience</b></p>		
		<p class="text">The department is responsible for the specification of equipment 
			to be use on the refinery floor. In most cases the request for the specification 
			comes from the process department, they will determine the process and produce 
			the required documents and calculations to guide the design department. 
			The design department will then investigate the site and determine the best way 
			forward to execute the job.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="text">During the design process of the job the design engineer will call 
			upon the services of the drawing department. This department is staffed with 
			draughts persons who assist with the production of the required drawings that 
			illustrate the existing or the potential situation on site. During the job the 
			engineer will consult with these draughts persons drawing upon their knowledge 
			and experience base to generate further possible solutions to the problem/task 
			at hand.</p>  			
		</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<p class="text">After the design of the job it has to be written up this is where a BM 
			is proposed. The BM as it called is actually a Bill of Materials, which by its name 
			is misleading. It is actually the documentation of the sequence of events that must 
			take place for the job to be executed properly. It also details the equipment and 
			the materials to be used to fulfill the job requirements. The BM will specify the 
			appropriate standards that are to be used. It is a Scope of Works for the job yet 
			to be done.</p>

		<div>
			<p class="text">Whilst at the refinery I was assigned to an engineer during 
				which time I assisted with some calculations regarding the Constant 
				Effort Spring Supports on 4 VDU, having my name added to the BM as a result. 
				As this situation unfolded I kept in contact with the engineer assisting and 
				volunteering where possible, also accompanying out to the plant floor to aid 
				in the investigation of the plant conditions.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="text">
				In other situations my exposure covered a greater area of the refinery compound 
				extending from North Area: The Machine, Tube and Bundle Shops, 4 VDU, 2 Girbotol, 
				the API Oil-Water Separators and F.C.C.U. onwards to the West Area: The Simpsons Sumps, 
				The tank farm and The Berths.
